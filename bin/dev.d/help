${bold}usage:${normal} bin/dev <command> <args>

${bold}setup${normal}
    Sets up environment files, download required docker images, and
    perform their initial set up commands, and seed the database

${bold}server${normal}
    Runs the entire development structure. This delegates directly
    to docker-compose, so if you're comfortable with it, you can do things
    such as:
      bin/dev server -d: start the server in daemon mode
      bin/dev server web: start only the web container (and it's dependencies)

${bold}console${normal}
    Attach to a running instance of the Elixir console. Use this
    when bin/server is already running

${bold}exec${normal}
    Runs a command inside the platform container.

${bold}stop${normal}
    Stops any running containers.

${bold}destroy${normal}
    Deletes existing database volumes. This might be useful if you want
    to run bin/setup again to reset and re-seed the database.
